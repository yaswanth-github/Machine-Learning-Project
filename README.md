# Optimized Learning Pathways Using Machine Learning to Personalize Online Courses
This project investigates the use of machine learning to predict and optimize student learning pathways based on data from the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD). 

The dataset includes detailed records of student interactions with online learning materials, demographics, assessment performance, and module-related information. The goal of this research is to identify patterns in student behaviour and engagement that predict success or failure, and to create optimized learning pathways that enhance student performance and retention.

The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the application of various machine learning models, such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting. The results of these models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and feature importance. Key insights are drawn from the analysis, revealing that engagement, timeliness of submission, and previous attempts at a module are among the most critical factors influencing student success. 

This study also identifies socioeconomic factors, such as deprivation levels, which significantly impact student outcomes, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions.


This report covers all stages of the project, from data cleaning and merging to detailed analysis and model development, and concludes with recommendations for future work, such as real-time predictions and personalized learning pathways.
